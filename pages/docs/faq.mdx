Welcome to the Lawnchair FAQ! This page provides answers to frequently asked questions about Lawnchair. Note that this FAQ is mostly related to the latest version of Lawnchair, because other versions are not supported. Some parts may have instructions for older versions of Lawnchair.

## General
### How to download Lawnchair?
* [Latest Lawnchair build](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/releases) (or download in [the website](https://lawnchair.app))
* [Play Store version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.deletescape.lawnchair.plah) (unsupported)

### What's the latest version of Lawnchair?
The latest version of Lawnchair that is actively supported is **Lawnchair 12.1 Alpha 4**.

### What's the difference between the Play Store, Telegram/Discord, and GitHub releases?
* Play Store release: Has Lawnchair v2, which is an older implementation of the launcher.
* Telegram or Discord: Shows the latest versions of Lawnchair 12.1
* GitHub: Same as above; you can also download the development versions on GitHub.

### Do you still support the Play Store version?
Unfortunately not. We no longer support the play store version; issues about it won't be accepted. This is done to focus development on making Lawnchair 12.1 finished and making it similar to Lawnchair 2. Also, maintaining legacy code is not a focus of the developers.

### What's the differences between Lawnchair V2 and 12.1?
V2 is the latest stable version of Lawnchair. It has many more features and is more stable, but is now outdated and unsupported. On the other hand, 11-12.1 is a complete redesign from scratch. Not all features have been re-implemented yet, but it does have Material You and all the new Android 11-12.1 features.

### Can you return a feature from Lawnchair 2?
Most legacy features that are present in Lawnchair 2 will be eventually added to Lawnchair 12+. You do not need to request a legacy feature as they are already in the dev's to-do list.

### When is the next ETA?
Nobody knows, not even us developers. We have other hobbies and jobs, or even school, and cannot full-time code to meet a deadline. That's why we don't give ETAs. (In case you were wondering, ETA means Estimated Time of Arrival, which means "when is the next version")

## Development versions
### What are these "debug" or "development" versions?
The debug versions are an "experimental" version of the latest version of Lawnchair. It has the newest features, may fix some bugs, and more. But keep in mind that it is _very unstable_, and it also updates frequently.

### How do I download the development versions?
Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/actions), select the latest workflow run, and scroll down and click on the "Debug Apk" file, below "Artifacts". Note that you'll need to have a GitHub account to download the Debug Apk.

### There's a Recents menu page, but it is not working. Why?
By default, the development versions show the Recents menu settings. Don't worry, it won't do anything unless you have QuickSwitch.

## Common issues
### How do I get the Google Feed (Discover)?
**Note:** You'll need the Google app to be installed for Lawnfeed to work.

For Lawnchair 11 and above, download [Lawnfeed 3](https://lawnchair.app) first. For Lawnchair V2, 9, or 10, see [Lawnfeed 2](https://www.apkmirror.com/wp-content/themes/APKMirror/download.php?id=865322) instead. For the development builds, you don't need to have Lawnfeed since those builds can already access the Google Feed API.

To enable the Google Feed, go to Home Settings > Home Screen > Enable Feed toggle

### Lawnfeed does not work!!!
You can try the below steps to fix your issue:
* Turn on/off the Feed toggle in Home Settings > General
* Force-stopping Google and Lawnfeed, and restarting Lawnchair
* Restarting your device
* Prevent Lawnfeed from sleeping (see Dontkillmyapp.com)

If it still doesn't work after you tried the above steps, try waiting. The issue sometimes fixes itself over time.

### How do I hide applications from my app drawer?
Long-press on the app you want to hide, tap on "Customize" or the pencil icon, then select "Hide from App Drawer"

### Adding widgets makes Lawnchair crash
This is a common issue (especially when the widget has a settings screen), and here's a temporary solution:
1. Change the default launcher to your system launcher.
2. Open Lawnchair.
3. Add the widget.
4. Re-set Lawnchair as the default launcher.

Unfortunately, there isn't a fix for this yet.

### App shortcuts are gone!
Unfortunately, this bug hasn't been fixed yet. You can still view app shortcuts by searching the app until you see only the app and a list of its shortcuts.

### How can I set the font to Google Sans?
Google Sans is a proprietary font and we are not allowed to add it. You can still search the web for the Google Sans font download, and set a custom font in Home Settings > General > Font > Add a new font.

### On my rooted device, the on-device search feature does not work.
Try uninstalling all updates of Android System Intelligence. This should usually fix the issue.

### On Android 13+, I can't notification access/accessibility/etc due to a popup saying "Restricted settings".
To enable restricted settings on Android 13+, head to Home Settings > Click the 3 dots in the top > App Info. After that, click the 3 dots at the top then press "Allow restricted settings". Once that's done you should be able to enable Accessibility, Notification access, and anything else that was restricted.

## Themed Icons
### Where can I download Lawnicons?
You can download Lawnicons on either [the website](https://lawnchair.app) or [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons).

### How do I enable themed icons?
Once you have Lawnicons (or another compatible app), go to Home Settings > General > Icon Style > Themed Icons. Then choose from showing it on the Home Screen, Home Screen & App Drawer, or not showing it at all.

### My themed icons look quite weird. Is there any way to fix this?
Disable force dark on Lawnchair on your phone settings.

### Are there any versions of Lawnicons with better icons or something similar?
You can either use:
* [Lawnicons development versions ](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons#download) (version of Lawnicons with more icons but is not ready for a full release)
* [Rkicons](https://github.com/RadekBledowski/rkicons) (a style similar to the legacy development versions of Lawnicons)
* [Saricons](https://github.com/SARRAF-5757/Saricons) (a popular Lawnicons alternative in the discord server)

Note that you must uninstall the original Lawnicons to be able to install this app.

## Recents screen
### Why is the recent screen buggy?
Unfortunately, it is because the system launcher handles the Recents screen. 

Therefore, if you change the default launcher, weird things can happen, such as:
* Recents taking too long to open
* Non-fluid animations
* Home screen crashes/reflashing

The only way to fix this is by having a Magisk module called QuickSwitch.

### The app open/close animations look buggy.
The system launcher also handles these animations. There is nothing that Lawnchair can do about it unless you have QuickSwitch.

### Where's the "select" feature of the Recents screen?
Because the Select feature from the Pixel Launcher is hard to port (we have tried and failed), we replaced the select functionality with the Google Lens button (which allows for the same functionality + other benefits of Lens).

Be sure to have the Lens app installed alongside the Google app, then restart Lawnchair to enable this feature.

### What is QuickSwitch???
[QuickSwitch](https://github.com/skittles9823/QuickSwitch) is a Magisk module that enables third-party launchers (like Lawnchair) to access the Recents (QuickStep) APIs, therefore allowing support for Recents customization and more features.

### I'm experiencing lag after I set Lawnchair as a QuickStep provider. What do I do?
If you're experiencing jank/lag after setting a Recents provider you need to disable Magisk hide on `com.google.android.gms`. This is a Magisk issue, it happens with all modules that use overlays in `/product` and `/vendor`.

If you still wish to pass CTS, make sure to keep `com.google.android.gms.unstable` hidden
